This is a basic contact management app which is integrated along with a maps and chart dashboard that shows covid cases in form of Line graph and Total numner of deaths, active cases in the form of a popup on the world map.

I have used Redux for state management and to save, edit and delete the contacts accordingly.

When the user opens the web app, there will be two buttons in the sidebar. One for contacts and one for maps.

When the user clicks on Contacts section, the user will be able to see a create contact button, in which the user can enter the details of thee contact and then save it, which will then be displayed below in the form of card. The user can later edit or delete the contact accordingly.

In the maps section, the page is divided into two sections, the upper section shows covid data in the form of line graph and the second section shows a world map in which you can see the total number of cases and deaths in a country by simply clicking on the marker of that particular country.
